        <h2>Client</h2>
        <p>Canvas is a web based learning management system that helps schools keep track of classes, assignments, tests, and allow students to communicate with their teacher in a convenient way. </p>

        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>While the UI for Canvas is pretty good, Instructure wanted to address feedback from users to make changes to the email, assignments, calendar, and media pages to make them more intuitive, usable, and satisfy student needs. </p>

        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>After taking the time to understand the client’s needs and goals, we followed up with current users to discover what their user habits were and to get their feedback on what they would want changed to help their class workflow. </p>
